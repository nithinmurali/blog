The request object will be passed only if DRF constructs the serializer for you, for example when you just pass the serializer_class to a ModelViewSet. But if you are using the Serializer in your custom views, please do remember to pass the request manually, otherwise it wonâ€™t work.
item_serializer = ItemSerializer(item, context={"request": request})
